### Repository Naming Conventions
#### Game Repositories
We're standardizing our game repository naming convention.   We want our repositories to be easily identifiable at a glance.    Ideally we would use the following format:

League-YYYY-GameName-Team#######

* League = FTC or FRC
* YYYY = Year of the game
* GameName = Name of the game
* Team####### = Team plus the team's number.
  * **FTC example:** Team19545
  * **FRC example:** Team3291

**Full example:**

FTC-2024-IntoTheDeep-Team19545

or

FRC-2024-Reefscape-Team3291

### Other Respositories ###
Generally, we want to try and group things to area.  Currently, we have the following areas:
* Website - Website is intended to be the repository for our future website for the teams
* Library - Library is code of functionality that we've used in the past without necessarily being the full code repository.
* Outreach - Outreach is repositories we use for outreach robots or events

There could be many other areas we do, but for now those are the ones we use.
